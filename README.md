## Not to offend anyone, it's a play with the word sex and the saxophone instrument
Why not combine both? The idea for this site was just to join them both.
The design and code were based on Wes Bos JS 30 drumkit challenge. If you want an explanation on how to do it, just google for it, there's a very good youtube video from the creator on the code behind it.

If there's a request for a male voice please create a pull request.
